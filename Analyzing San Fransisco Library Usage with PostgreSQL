-- Data from Kaggle and SF Public Library

-- Exploratory analysis of data
-- What is the total number of users (rows) in the database?
Select count(patroncode) from sflib 
-- 423,448 users

-- Find the range of years the database encompasses
select distinct yearregistered from sflib
-- database spans from 2003 to 2006

-- Find all the distinct library branches
select distinct homelibdef from sflib

-- How many unique patron codes are there?
Select count(Distinct patroncode) from sflib
-- 18 patron codes

-- Find the home library, year registered, and patron type of all adult patrons
Select homelibdef, yearregistered, patrontype from sflib
where patrontype = 'ADULT'

-- exploratory analysis
-- the database doesn't have a columnn that identifies each user by a library number or patron ID. Let's make one:
add column assigning a patron id to each column
alter table sflib

add column patronid INTEGER;
create sequence patronidseq;
update sflib  
  set patronid = nextval('patronidseq');
drop sequence patronidseq;

-- find total number of checkouts that are over 1,000 checkouts
select * from sflib
where totalcheckouts > 1000

-- Within the last 5 years, how many people in each year have made a library account? 
select distinct avg(totalcheckouts), patrontype  from sflib
where yearregistered between '2010' and '2015'
GROUP by patrontype

-- What is the average number of check outs and renewals by patron type within the last 5 years?
select distinct avg(totalcheckouts), patrontype  from sflib
where yearregistered between '2010' and '2015'
GROUP by patrontype

-- What is the total number of books checked out by each patron type?
select distinct patrontype, sum(totalcheckouts) from sflib
group by patrontype
order by sum(totalcheckouts) DESC

-- Find the top 10 library users with the most total checkouts
select sum(totalcheckouts), patronid
from sflib
group by patronid
order by sum(totalcheckouts) DESC
Limit 10
